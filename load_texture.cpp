/*
As mentioned in the last lesson, textures are the GPU rendering equivalent of surfaces. 
Hence, textures are almost always created from surfaces, using the function SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface(). 
This function more or less does what you'd expectâ€”the parameters are the rendering context and a surface 
to create the texture from. As with other creation functions, it will return NULL on failure.

    SDL_FreeSurface(surface);
    return res;
